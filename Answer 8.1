1. Calculate the average salary by gender and smoking status.

> aggregate(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, by = list(RcmdrTestDrive$gender, RcmdrTestDrive$smoking),
+           FUN =mean)
  Group.1   Group.2        x
1  Female Nonsmoker 692.9093
2    Male Nonsmoker 740.9080
3  Female    Smoker 733.2122
4    Male    Smoker 751.4900
> # average salary by gender
> aggregate(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, by = list(RcmdrTestDrive$gender),
+           FUN =mean)
  Group.1        x
1  Female 698.0911
2    Male 743.3915
> # average salary by smoking status
> aggregate(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, by = list(RcmdrTestDrive$smoking),
+ FUN =mean)
    Group.1        x
1 Nonsmoker 719.3792
2    Smoker 746.3494

> # standard deviation of salary by gender.
> aggregate(RcmdrTestDrive$salary, by = list(RcmdrTestDrive$gender),
+           FUN =sd)
  Group.1        x
